# Project Freedom
## Final Project for Linear Algebra for Data Science

Joint effort between Chris Bloodsworth and Jonathan Levy.

Implementation of a simple neural network in numpy, without the aid of traditional libraries (keras, pytorch, etc.)

## Workflow

For now, the workflow goes something like this:

- Make changes to your own branch, push to it. I want to keep it simple with
    just developer-specific branches for now, though we can transition to
    feature branches if the need arises.
- Try to make sure it adheres to black formatting - if not, it'll need to get
    formatted to proceed with the pull request.
    - Also, all unit tests will need to pass before merging.
- When you've made your changes and are ready, make the pull request to main. 
    You will need the other developer's approval to merge into main.
